We are making an interactive documentary on BL, focusing on the current site in H, NJ. BL was the R&D arm of AT&T and arguably the preeminent innovation hub of the 20th Century, credited with the development of radio astronomy, the transistor, the laser, C programming language, and more. Seven nobel prizes were awarded for work completed in this space, which is now largely overshadowed in popular imagination by Silicon Valley, yet its work remains vital. The space is currently at a crossroads as its future is debated; it seems like development will begin soon, and the current buildings and link to technology may be lost.

We have filmed the BL space (largely abandoned) on the ground and with drone cameras, and are interviewing individuals who have worked at, written about, or are developing new plans for it. We'll present this as a browser-based interactive integrating  timelines showing the innovations created, and the eventual decline.


We want to incorporate an interactive timeline that demonstrates the history of Bl and what was created there, as well as an interactive map showing the bl area and what was made where. We hope everyone intrigued about the history of technological innovation generally, and the critical role Bl played in its heyday more specifically, will be interested. We are also targeting the story towards those who grew up in the internet age, so that they can be reminded of the predecessors to companies like Google
